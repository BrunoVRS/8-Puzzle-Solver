# 8-Puzzle-Solver
This code is an implementation of A* (A-star) search algorithm, with the purpose of solving the NP-hard problem of 8-Puzzle

In order to use it copy the file named as A_star.py, and, at the end, change the values in the matrix called "problema".
All the steps in which to follow will be displayed bottom-up, i.e., you start following the steps by the last printed matrix, up to the first.
